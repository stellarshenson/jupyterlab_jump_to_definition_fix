# Claude Code Journal

This journal tracks substantive work on documents, diagrams, and documentation content.

1. **Task - Project initialization**: Set up project documentation structure and journal for jupyterlab_jump_to_definition_fix extension<br>
    **Result**: Created JOURNAL.md and confirmed .claude/CLAUDE.md exists. Project is a JupyterLab 4 extension (frontend-and-server type) that fixes the 'jump to definition' action from notebooks to source files in the notebook's kernel context. Without this fix, packages would need to be installed in the same environment as JupyterLab to allow jump to definition functionality. Package structure includes TypeScript frontend (src/index.ts), Python backend (jupyterlab_jump_to_definition_fix/routes.py), and server extension configuration

2. **Task - Implement jump-to-definition fix**: Research and implement kernel-based introspection for jump-to-definition<br>
    **Result**: Implemented complete solution with backend introspection code handler and frontend command. Discovered that built-in LSP uses command ID `lsp:jump-to-definition` with keyboard shortcut `Accel B` (Ctrl+B). Updated extension to override this shortcut with our kernel-based introspection command. Added comprehensive logging with `[JumpToDef]` prefix for debugging. Extension now intercepts Ctrl+B in notebooks to use kernel introspection instead of LSP, allowing jump-to-definition to work for packages installed in kernel environment rather than JupyterLab environment. Version 0.1.7 installed successfully

3. **Task - Fix namespace resolution**: Resolve issue where imported symbols couldn't be found by introspection code<br>
    **Result**: Fixed backend introspection code in routes.py to use `sys.modules['__main__'].__dict__` to access the kernel's main namespace. The previous approach using `get_ipython().user_ns` failed because code executed via `kernel.requestExecute()` runs in an isolated context. By directly accessing the `__main__` module's namespace (where IPython executes all user code including imports), the introspection code can now resolve imported symbols like `PROJ_ROOT` and `MODELS_DIR` from `lib_hackathon_functional_model.config`. Version 0.1.10 built and installed successfully

4. **Task - Implement Jedi static analysis**: Replace kernel introspection with Jedi static analysis to support unexecuted cells<br>
    **Result**: Completely rewrote the jump-to-definition implementation to use Jedi static analysis executed in the kernel's Python environment. The previous approaches (kernel introspection with `sys.modules['__main__']`, static analysis with `sys.modules`, dynamic LSP configuration) all failed because they either required symbols to be already imported/executed or encountered issues with LSP adapters not existing when commands ran. The final working solution executes Jedi's `Script.goto()` method inside the kernel, which provides static analysis capabilities while automatically using the kernel's `sys.path` for module resolution. Implementation details: Frontend collects all notebook code cell sources and concatenates them with newlines, calculates absolute cursor position across cells (Jedi uses 1-based line numbers), sends these along with notebook path to backend which provides Jedi introspection code template with placeholders. Backend template imports Jedi, creates `jedi.Project` with kernel's `sys.path`, runs `Script.goto()` with `follow_imports=True`, and returns JSON result with file path and line number. Frontend executes template in kernel, captures stdout (JSON result) separately from stderr (debug logs), parses result, converts absolute filesystem path to JupyterLab-relative path by comparing kernel CWD with notebook relative path to calculate server root, then opens file with `docManager.openOrReveal()`. Removed all debug console logs for production. Created comprehensive documentation in APPROACH_SUMMARY.md documenting all attempted approaches and why they failed.
